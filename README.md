# Students Adaptability Level Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the effectiveness of online education using various machine learning techniques in R. The dataset consists of multiple features, including gender, education level, institution type, financial condition, internet access, and adaptivity level, which were used to predict the adaptivity level of students. The project involved several stages, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of different regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation and resampling techniques, and key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared were analyzed to compare the models. The best-performing model was saved and deployed via a Plumber API for real-time predictions. This solution provides valuable insights into the factors that influence online education effectiveness, helping to guide future improvements in educational practices.
